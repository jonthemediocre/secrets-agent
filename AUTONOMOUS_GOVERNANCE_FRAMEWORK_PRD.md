# 🏛️ Autonomous Governance Framework - Product Requirements Document

## **📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The **Autonomous Governance Framework (AGF)** is an industry-first system that provides automated oversight, validation, and deployment governance for AI-driven development operations. This framework enables autonomous systems to make deployment decisions while maintaining enterprise-grade security, compliance, and risk management.

### **Key Value Propositions:**
- **Autonomous Decision Making:** AI systems can deploy code autonomously with proper oversight
- **Multi-tier Expert Review:** Automated expert assignment based on risk assessment
- **Real-time Risk Assessment:** Continuous evaluation of deployment safety
- **Cross-project Learning:** Knowledge sharing across autonomous operations
- **Enterprise Compliance:** SOC2, GDPR, ISO27001 compliant governance

---

## **🎯 PRODUCT OVERVIEW**

### **Product Name:** Autonomous Governance Framework (AGF)
### **Product Type:** AI Governance & Deployment Automation System
### **Target Market:** Enterprise AI Development Teams, DevOps Organizations
### **Integration Model:** Pluggable framework for existing AI/ML pipelines

### **Core Problem Solved:**
Current AI systems lack the governance infrastructure to make autonomous deployment decisions safely. Manual oversight creates bottlenecks, while unsupervised automation creates unacceptable risks.

### **Solution Approach:**
A multi-tier Coalition of Experts (CoE) system that automatically evaluates deployment requests, assigns appropriate reviewers, and manages the entire governance lifecycle with full audit trails.
