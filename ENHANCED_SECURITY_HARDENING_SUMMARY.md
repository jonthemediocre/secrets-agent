## 🛡️ Enhanced Security Features

### 1. **Zero-Trust Security Model**
```python
✅ Every action requires identity verification
✅ No implicit trust for any agent or operation
✅ Continuous security validation throughout execution
✅ Environment-aware security controls
```

### 2. **Multi-Layer Action Validation**

#### **8-Step Security Validation Process:**
1. 🔍 **Agent Identity Verification** - Registry-based agent authentication
2. 📊 **Rate Limiting Check** - Per-agent action frequency controls
3. 🔒 **Action Payload Validation** - Injection attack prevention
4. 🚨 **Threat Assessment** - Multi-factor risk analysis
5. 📈 **Security Score Calculation** - Comprehensive risk scoring
6. 🔑 **Approval Requirements** - MFA/CoE integration
7. ✅ **Final Status Determination** - Go/no-go decision
8. 🎫 **Validation Token Generation** - Cryptographic execution permits

### 3. **Advanced Threat Detection**

#### **Threat Indicators Monitored:**
- ⏰ **After-hours execution** (suspicious timing)
- 📈 **High-frequency activity** (potential automation abuse)
- 🏭 **Production environment** (elevated risk)
- ⚠️ **High severity actions** (critical system changes)
- 🔍 **Payload injection patterns** (security attack vectors)
- 🤖 **Unknown agent activity** (unauthorized agents)

#### **Threat Level Classification:**
```
🟢 MINIMAL   - Normal operations (0.0-0.2 threat score)
🟡 LOW       - Minor concerns (0.2-0.4 threat score)
🟠 MODERATE  - Elevated risk (0.4-0.6 threat score)
🔴 HIGH      - Significant risk (0.6-0.8 threat score)
⚫ CRITICAL  - Maximum risk (0.8+ threat score)
```

### 4. **Cryptographic Security**

#### **Encryption & Signing:**
- 🔐 **PBKDF2-SHA256** key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- 🔒 **Fernet symmetric encryption** for sensitive data
- ✍️ **HMAC-SHA256 digital signatures** for audit integrity
- 🎫 **JWT tokens** with expiration for action authorization

#### **Immutable Audit Chain:**
```python
Each audit record contains:
├── Unique audit ID + timestamp
├── Action context & execution results
├── Security validation details
├── Cryptographic hash of record contents
├── Digital signature for authenticity
└── Hash link to previous record (blockchain-style)
```

### 5. **Approval Workflows**

#### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
- 🔑 **Required for CRITICAL and EMERGENCY actions**
- 🎫 **Time-limited validation tokens**
- 🔒 **Secondary verification channels**

#### **Coalition of Experts (CoE):**
- 🏛️ **Required for EMERGENCY severity actions**
- 👥 **Expert committee review and approval**
- 📋 **Documented decision rationale**

### 6. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

#### **Dynamic Rate Controls:**
```python
Default Limits:
├── 20 actions per minute per agent
├── Sliding window enforcement
├── Automatic blocking for violations
└── Progressive penalties for repeat offenders
```

#### **Behavioral Analysis:**
- 📊 **Action frequency monitoring**
- 🎯 **Pattern recognition for abuse**
- 🚫 **Automatic agent blocking**
- ⚠️ **Security alert generation**
