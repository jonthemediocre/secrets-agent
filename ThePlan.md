# 📜 ThePlan.md — Secrets Agent: Agentic Infrastructure Blueprint (v2)

---

## 🧬 Mission & Vision

**Secrets Agent** is evolving beyond a mere secrets manager into a foundational **agentic infrastructure component**.

**Core Mission:** To provide an exceptionally secure, locally-hosted, and programmatically extensible vault for managing secrets, configurations, and eventually, agentic toolsets.

**Strategic Vision:** To serve as a private, auditable, and resilient backbone for both human developers and autonomous AI agents, enabling secure and efficient secret access, lifecycle management, and inter-agent cooperation. This platform aims to combine the rigor of cryptographic best practices with the flexibility of modern agentic architectures.

---

## 🚀 Core Architectural Pillars & Differentiators

*   **Agent-Native by Design:** Unlike traditional secret managers (1Password, Doppler, HashiCorp Vault), Secrets Agent is engineered from the ground up to be queried, mutated, and extended by other software agents. This is a primary strategic advantage.
*   **Real Cryptographic Rigor (SOPS + Age):** Anchored in robust, auditable encryption using SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) with Age encryption. This provides a verifiable security layer, not just obfuscation.
*   **Local-First, Encrypted Storage:** All vault data is stored locally and encrypted, ensuring user control, privacy, and full offline capability—a significant advantage over cloud-dependent solutions.
*   **Rich, Project-Based Vault Schema:** Features a structured, project-aware vault with comprehensive metadata per secret (tags, timestamps, source, notes), surpassing the often flat key-value UX of many CLI-first tools.
*   **Cross-Platform Parity (Mobile & Web):** Built with React Native and Expo, targeting both mobile and web interfaces for consistent user experience and accessibility.
*   **Token-Aware HTTP Management (`AuthAgent`, `APIManagerAgent`):** Integrated capabilities for secure token handling, refresh, and injection for authenticated operations.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities & Feature Roadmap (Iterative)

*(Reflects current status and near-term goals based on recent audit)*

### Phase 1: Core Vault & Authentication (Largely Complete)

*   **[✅] Secure User Authentication (`AuthAgent`):** Google OAuth (Expo/Web), PKCE, token management, secure storage, user profile. Fully tested.
*   **[✅] Foundational Vault Structure (`VaultAgent` - In-Memory):** Schema (`VaultTypes.ts`), CRUD for projects/secrets, global tags. Tested (in-memory).
*   **[✅] SOPS Encrypted Vault I/O (`VaultAgent` + `SOPSIntegration`):**
    *   Logic for `sops` CLI interaction to encrypt/decrypt vault (`SOPSIntegration.ts`).
    *   `VaultAgent.loadVault()` & `saveVault()` integrated with SOPS.
    *   Rigorous testing with mocked SOPS CLI completed.

### Phase 2: Enhancing Core & Agentic Capabilities

*   **[🧊 TODO] Full `.env` Import/Export Flow (UI & Logic):**
    *   **Priority 2:** Scan `.env`, preview mappings, confirm, commit to vault. For export: filter, redact toggle, download.
    *   Address potential conflicts and provide clear user feedback.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Secret Rotation Tracking & Reminders (Dashboard Integration):**
    *   **Priority 3:** Add `rotationPolicy` (e.g., `duration`, `nextRotationDate`), `lastRotated` to `SecretEntry`.
    *   Implement warnings/visual cues in the future `SecretsPanel.tsx`.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Per-Secret Access Logs (Auditing):**
    *   Introduce `accessedAt: string[]` or a more structured log to `SecretEntry` or a separate (optionally unencrypted for performance) `.vault.accesslog.yaml`.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Environment Switching UX (`dev`, `stage`, `prod` vaults):**
    *   Surface existing support for environment-suffixed vault files (e.g., `app.secrets.dev.yaml`) in the UI.
    *   Add a UI toggle and potentially auto-detection based on project context (e.g., git branch, folder).
*   **[🧊 TODO] Vault File Switching / Multi-Profile Mode:**
    *   Dedicated UI component (`VaultSwitcher`) and API abstraction.

### Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Features & Ecosystem Integration

*   **[🧊 TODO] Secret Suggestion via Code/README Scan (`SecretScaffoldAgent`):**
    *   New agent to analyze `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md` etc., to suggest secret schemas or missing secrets.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Secrets Misuse Detection (Watchdog):**
    *   Optional service/feature to alert if decrypted files (e.g., temporary `.env` from export) persist unencrypted for too long.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Multi-Key Sharing for Vaults (Age Recipients):**
    *   Extend vault creation/management to support multiple `age` public keys for shared team vaults (serverless sharing).
*   **[🧊 TODO] Vault Fingerprint Hashing (Integrity Check):**
    *   Display a SHA256 hash of the (potentially canonicalized) `.vault.yaml` content in the UI for integrity verification.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Per-Secret Access Control (Granular Permissions):**
    *   Even for single-user, allow flags like "hidden from auto-export," "require confirmation for access/export."
*   **[🧊 TODO] Secret History Timeline (Visual):**
    *   Track changes per-secret, potentially stored in a `.vault-history.yaml` or integrated with Git if the vault is in a repo.

### P3: Secret Lifecycle Management - Rotation (Conceptual)
- **Objective**: Implement mechanisms for automated and manual secret rotation.
- **Components**:
    - P3.1: Model `RotationPolicy.ts`
    - P3.2: Agent `SecretRotatorAgent.ts`
    - P3.3: Service `RotationSchedulerService.ts`
    - P3.4: API Endpoints for rotation
    - P3.5: UI Components for rotation policy management
    - P3.6: Test Suite for rotation

### UI/UX Principles & Framework
- **Inspiration**: HashiCorp Vault UI (clear navigation, contextual main area, action-oriented design).
- **Key UI Components Needed (Conceptual Drafts Done for some):**
    - `AppLayout.tsx` - Main application shell.
    - `EnvManagerPanel.tsx` - For `.env` import/export.
    - `RotationPolicyManager.tsx` - For managing secret rotation policies.
- **Chosen UI Framework**: `shadcn/ui` will be adopted for building the user interface. This decision aims to leverage its accessible, customizable, and modern component library.
    - **Impact**: Existing conceptual UI drafts (`AppLayout.tsx`, `EnvManagerPanel.tsx`, `RotationPolicyManager.tsx`) will need to be refactored to utilize `shadcn/ui` components. Core setup of `shadcn/ui` will be a prerequisite.

### Phase 4: Advanced Vault Operations (Conceptual)

*   **[🧊 TODO] Secret Sharing via Code/README Scan (`SecretScaffoldAgent`):**
    *   New agent to analyze `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md` etc., to suggest secret schemas or missing secrets.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Secrets Misuse Detection (Watchdog):**
    *   Optional service/feature to alert if decrypted files (e.g., temporary `.env` from export) persist unencrypted for too long.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Multi-Key Sharing for Vaults (Age Recipients):**
    *   Extend vault creation/management to support multiple `age` public keys for shared team vaults (serverless sharing).
*   **[🧊 TODO] Vault Fingerprint Hashing (Integrity Check):**
    *   Display a SHA256 hash of the (potentially canonicalized) `.vault.yaml` content in the UI for integrity verification.
*   **[🧊 TODO] Per-Secret Access Control (Granular Permissions):**
    *   Even for single-user, allow flags like "hidden from auto-export," "require confirmation for access/export."
*   **[🧊 TODO] Secret History Timeline (Visual):**
    *   Track changes per-secret, potentially stored in a `.vault-history.yaml` or integrated with Git if the vault is in a repo.

## 💡 Visionary Threads & Future Architecture

### 1. `.cursor rules MDC` (Markdown Component Rules)

*   **Concept:** A system for defining, parsing, and enforcing operational rules or behavioral expectations for agents and UI components within the "Secrets Agent" ecosystem.
*   **Implementation Idea:**
    *   Store rules in `docs/rules/*.mdc` or a central `docs/RULES.md`.
    *   Develop a lightweight parser or convention for these rules.
    *   Integrate rule checks/awareness into agent logic (e.g., `VaultAgent` checks a rule before performing a sensitive operation) or UI components.
    *   Provide mechanisms for "tagging" code sections or agent functions with relevant rule IDs for discoverability and documentation.

### 2. MCP Tool Repository as a Secure Vault

*   **Concept:** Extend the `VaultAgent` paradigm to manage a registry of available tools (MCP tools, other agent capabilities, CLI paths, API keys for tools) as a secure, encrypted `.tool.vault.yaml`.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Decentralized, secure tool discovery.
    *   `APIManagerAgent` or a new `ToolBrokerAgent` could query this vault for tool availability, versions, permissions, or access credentials.
    *   Enables dynamic, secure tool management without hardcoding, unique in the local-first agent space.

### 3. A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Standard & Manifest

*   **Concept:** Define a standardized format (`a2a.yaml` or `AgentManifest.ts` interfaces) for agents to declare their capabilities, inputs, outputs, tool needs, and trust levels. This facilitates robust, predictable inter-agent cooperation. **Foundational work for this has significantly progressed with the implementation and governance of the Kernel Event Bus (KEB), including core event schemas and client libraries, establishing a robust mechanism for inter-agent messaging.**
*   **Proposed Manifest Fields:**
    *   `agentId`: Unique identifier for the agent.
    *   `version`: Semantic version of the agent's interface.
    *   `description`: Human-readable purpose.
    *   `intent`: High-level goal the agent serves (could be a standardized vocabulary).
    *   `inputSchema`: JSON schema defining required input structure.
    *   `outputSchema`: JSON schema defining guaranteed output structure.
    *   `toolRequirements`: List of tools/services needed (e.g., `sops_cli`, `google_oauth_token`).
    *   `permissionsRequired`: List of permissions this agent needs on resources (e.g., `vault:read:projectX`, `file:write:/temp`).
    *   `trustLevel`: e.g., `readOnly`, `mutatesStateNoConfirmation`, `mutatesStateWithConfirmation`.
    *   `invokeSignature`: How to call the agent (e.g., function name, API endpoint pattern).
    *   `errorCodes`: Standardized errors it might return.
    *   `fallbacks`: Optional strategies or alternative agents to call on failure.
*   **Impact:** Forms the basis for a symbolic cooperation protocol, moving beyond current ad-hoc agent integrations. **The KEB now provides the core mechanism to realize such a protocol.**

## 🏛️ External Ecosystem & Long-Term Integration Considerations

Insights from observing standard secrets management architectures (e.g., resembling HashiCorp Vault) highlight potential long-term evolution paths for the Secrets Agent, particularly if deeper integration with such ecosystems is desired.

### Key Architectural Parallels & Learnings:

*   **Cloud-Native Secrets Management Model:** Typical architectures involve:
    *   **Clients** (human or machine) authenticating via diverse **identity providers**.
    *   A central vault validating identity, applying **authorization rules**, and then retrieving secrets.
    *   Support for multiple **authentication methods** (GitHub, LDAP, AWS IAM, etc.) and various **secrets engines** (Key/Value, SSH, Database, cloud-specific).

### Relevance to `VaultAgent.ts` & Secrets Agent Evolution:

While the Secrets Agent is currently local-first, considering these patterns informs future development:

1.  **Enhanced Secret Metadata & Capabilities:**
    *   **Source Tagging:** The ability to tag secrets with their origin (e.g., imported from GitHub, AWS, or created via UI) could be valuable for auditing and context.
    *   **Dynamic Secret Engines/Token Types:** Future versions might explore concepts of dynamic or short-lived secrets, moving beyond static key-value pairs for certain use cases.
    *   **Authorization Logic & Audit Trails:** As the agent ecosystem grows, more sophisticated internal authorization logic or identity-linked audit trails for secret access might become necessary.

2.  **`.env` Import/Export Alignment:**
    *   The current `.env` import/export functionality aligns well with the common "Key/Value" secrets engine paradigm.
    *   The `SecretEntry` structure (key, value, tags, timestamps) is compatible with this model.
    *   Future extensions could involve mapping these to specific paths within a more structured backend if integrated with a hierarchical key/value store.

3.  **Potential HashiCorp Vault Integration (or similar):**
    *   If direct integration with an external HashiCorp Vault instance becomes a requirement, `VaultAgent.ts` would need:
        *   **API Connectors:** To securely communicate with the Vault API.
        *   **Path Mapping:** Logic to map `.env` files or project-specific secrets to appropriate Vault paths (e.g., `secrets/myproject/dev/.env`).
        *   **Authentication Handling:** Mechanisms to manage Vault tokens or other authentication methods required by the external Vault.
    *   This would shift `VaultAgent.ts` from a purely local SOPS-based manager to a hybrid or client interacting with a more powerful external secrets backend.

These considerations, while not immediate priorities, provide a strategic lens for future architectural decisions and feature development, ensuring the Secrets Agent can evolve to meet more complex enterprise or team-based requirements.
