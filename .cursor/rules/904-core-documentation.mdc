# Core Documentation Requirements (AI Assistant Guideline)

## Standard Documentation Set (AI Guideline)

The AI assistant should expect projects operating under this framework to typically include the following essential documents. `THEPLAN.md` remains the authoritative source for the specific documents required by any given project.

**Common Core Documents:**
- **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, and documentation links.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributors.
- **docs/architecture.md**: System architecture and design decisions.
- **TODO.md**: Current project tasks and priorities.
- **docs/ai-learnings.md**: AI insights and patterns recorded for reinforcement.

**Conditionally Expected Documents (Verify in `THEPLAN.md`):**
- **`docs/api-reference.md`**: Expected if the project exposes an API.
- **`docs/deployment.md`**: Expected if the project has specific deployment procedures.
- **`docs/changelog.md`**: Expected for projects implementing versioning or tracking significant milestones.
- **`docs/settings_reference.md`**: Expected for projects utilizing external configuration files (e.g., `config/settings.yaml`).
