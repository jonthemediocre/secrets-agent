# Project Reality Snapshot Protocol (Rule 907)

## Purpose
To standardize the format and content of project snapshot documents. These documents serve as a clear, concise summary of the project's current state, architecture, capabilities, and limitations, suitable for onboarding new team members, communicating with stakeholders, or providing context to external AI assistants.

## Standard Sections

Project snapshot documents (e.g., `VANTA_Project_Reality_Snapshot.md`) SHOULD include the following sections:

1.  **📦 Project Overview:** High-level purpose, core concepts.
2.  **🔑 Key Concepts & Terminology:** Glossary of project-specific terms (e.g., Crown, Pilgrim, Blueprint).
3.  **📁 Directory Structure (Simplified):** Key directories and their purpose.
4.  **📄 Key Files:** List of critical files and their roles.
5.  **⚙️ Configuration Summary:** Overview of primary configuration methods (e.g., `blueprint.yaml`, `.env`, `config.py`). Include a concise example if applicable (like an agent definition).
6.  **🌊 Execution Flow:** Simplified diagram or description of a primary workflow (e.g., task submission).
7.  **🔌 API Overview (If applicable):** List key endpoints, request/response formats (briefly), and authentication method.
8.  **✅ Current Capabilities & Limitations:** Bullet points summarizing what works and known limitations or pending work.
9.  **📊 Status Summary Table (Optional):** A table visualizing the completion status of different layers or features.
10. **🧭 Next Steps / Roadmap:** Brief outline of immediate future plans or the next development phase.
11. **📌 Final Package Summary:** A concluding paragraph summarizing the project's essence at the time of the snapshot.

## Naming Convention

- Use a clear naming convention, such as `PROJECTNAME_Snapshot_YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `PROJECTNAME_Reality_Snapshot_vX.Y.md`.
- Store snapshots in a consistent location, preferably `/docs/snapshots/` or the project root.

## Maintenance

- Snapshots should be updated at significant milestones (e.g., completion of a major patch cycle, release versions).
- Reference the specific milestone or version within the document title or introduction.

## Relation to Other Docs

- The snapshot provides a high-level summary. It should link to more detailed documents (`README.md`, `theplan.md`, architecture diagrams) where appropriate, rather than duplicating extensive detail.

# 907-Project-Snapshot-and-Status-Reporting

**Reason for Graduation (from globalrules.md):** Broad applicability, cross-project relevance

## Description

This rule defines the standards and procedures for creating project snapshots and reporting status. It ensures that there is a consistent way to capture the current state of a project, track progress against goals, and communicate this information effectively to stakeholders.
The specific content for this rule is yet to be defined in detail.
