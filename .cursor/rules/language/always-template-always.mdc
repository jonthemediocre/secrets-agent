# Always Rule Template

## Description

This is a template for creating always-enforced rules. These rules are mandatory and automatically applied in all applicable contexts.

## Enforcement

This rule is **mandatory** and will be enforced automatically without exception.

## Requirements

- Must be followed in all circumstances
- Violations will be flagged immediately
- No manual override available
- Applies to all relevant contexts

## Examples

### Required Pattern

```javascript
// Always use this pattern
const CONSTANT_VALUE = 'required-format';
```

### Prohibited Pattern

```javascript
// Never use this pattern
var variableName = 'prohibited-format';
```

## Rationale

### Why This Rule Exists

This rule exists to enforce critical standards that:
- Prevent common errors
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Maintain code quality standards
- Support automated tooling

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Uniform code patterns across all files
- **Quality**: Prevents low-quality code patterns
- **Automation**: Enables reliable automated checks
- **Maintainability**: Reduces cognitive load for developers

## Implementation

This rule will be automatically enforced by:
- Real-time code analysis
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline checks
- IDE integrations
