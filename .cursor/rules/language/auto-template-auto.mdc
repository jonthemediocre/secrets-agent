# Auto-Attached Rule Template

## Description

This is a template for creating auto-attached rules that apply automatically to files matching specific patterns.

## File Patterns

This rule automatically applies to files matching:

- `**/*.js` - JavaScript files
- `**/*.ts` - TypeScript files
- `**/*.jsx` - React JavaScript files
- `**/*.tsx` - React TypeScript files

## Automatic Application

When files matching the above patterns are detected, this rule will be:

- Applied automatically during editing
- Checked during file validation
- Enforced in build processes
- Available to AI assistants for context

## Rule Logic

### Trigger Conditions

The rule activates when:
1. File matches glob patterns
2. File is being edited or created
3. Automated checks are running

### Scope

This rule applies to:
- New file creation
- Existing file modifications
- Bulk operations on matching files

## Examples

### Matching Files

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Button.tsx     ✓ Matches
│   ├── Modal.jsx      ✓ Matches
│   └── styles.css     ✗ No match
├── utils/
│   ├── helpers.js     ✓ Matches
│   └── config.json    ✗ No match
```

### Pattern Application

```typescript
// This rule automatically applies to this TypeScript file
interface ComponentProps {
  // Rule-specific requirements here
}
```

## Configuration

### Pattern Customization

You can modify the glob patterns to:
- Include additional file types
- Exclude specific directories
- Add more specific patterns

### Example Patterns

```yaml
globs:
  - "src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"  # Source files only
  - "!**/*.test.*"              # Exclude test files
  - "components/**/*.vue"       # Vue components
```

## Rationale

Auto-attached rules provide:
- **Efficiency**: No manual rule selection needed
- **Coverage**: Automatic application to relevant files
- **Consistency**: Uniform application across file types
- **Integration**: Seamless tool integration

- Always rules that take precedence
