# Documentation Auto Rule Example

## Description

This is an example auto rule for documentation and comment standards. It demonstrates the proper structure and content for rules in the documentation category.

## Rule Implementation

This rule automatically applies to files matching the specified glob patterns. It activates based on file type and location.

## Examples

### Good Pattern

```javascript
// Example of following this rule
const examplePattern = {
  // Implementation that follows best practices
  property: 'value'
};
```

### Poor Pattern

```javascript
// Example of violating this rule
var badPattern = {
  // Implementation that violates the rule
  prop: 'val'
};
```

## Rationale

This rule exists to:
- Promote best practices in documentation and comment standards
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Prevent common mistakes and issues
- Support maintainable code patterns

## Related Rules
