# RULE TYPE: Best Practice
# RULE ID: 906-symbolic-definition-linking
# FILE PATTERNS: THEPLAN.md, docs/**/*.md, **/*_definitions.md, **/*.schema.json

# 906: Symbolic Definition ↔️ Plan Linking Rule

## 1. Purpose

Ensures that foundational definition documents (especially those related to the core symbolic layer, agent types, event schemas, or architectural primitives) are consistently reflected or referenced within the primary project plan (`THEPLAN.md`) and relevant architectural documentation. This maintains coherence between high-level planning and low-level definitions.

## 2. Trigger Conditions

This rule should be considered or automatically suggested when:
-   Files matching `**/*_definitions.md` (e.g., `vanta_agi_definitions.md`) are created or significantly modified.
-   Core schema files (`**/*.schema.json`) related to agent communication, events, or memory are changed.
-   Significant changes are made to symbolic concepts within `THEPLAN.md`.
-   New agents or core services are introduced that rely on specific symbolic or schematic definitions.

## 3. Required Action

-   **Cross-Reference:** Ensure that `THEPLAN.md` contains references to the relevant definition file(s) when discussing the concepts they define.
-   **Integrate Core Definitions:** For truly foundational definitions (like those in `vanta_agi_definitions.md`), relevant summaries or direct definitions SHOULD be integrated into the appropriate section of `THEPLAN.md` (e.g., Section 3: Core Architectural Philosophy).
-   **Update Architecture Docs:** If definition changes impact system architecture, ensure `docs/system_architecture_overview.md` or similar documents are updated or linked.
-   **Commit Annotation:** Use commit message tags like `#symbolic_sync` or `#definition_update` when performing these integrations.

## 4. Rationale

-   **Coherence:** Keeps the project plan aligned with the detailed definitions that underpin its concepts.
-   **Discoverability:** Makes it easier for developers and the AI to find the source-of-truth definitions for key terms and structures.
-   **Consistency:** Prevents divergence between high-level strategy and low-level implementation details.

## 5. Example

> Modified `vanta_agi_definitions.md` to refine the `Collapse` process. Updated Section 3 in `THEPLAN.md` with the new definition summary and linked back to the source MD file. #symbolic_sync
