# Rule 902 – Visual Asset Linking and Contextual Integration

## Title:
Visual Asset ↔️ Plan Linking Rule ("Visual-First Principle")

## Scope:
Applies to any visual asset introduced or referenced in:
- `symbolic_dashboard.html`
- `.mmd`, `.html`, `.svg`, `.png`, `.drawio`, `.mermaid`, `.py` files containing visual logic or diagrams
- System diagrams related to the Symbolic Layer, R → r collapse, or live agentic flows

## Trigger Conditions:
- New or modified files containing symbolic visualizations are committed
- `simulate_symbolic_agents.py`, `vanta_agi_kernel_final.mmd`, or similar diagrams updated
- Any mention of "visual workflow," "symbolic collapse," or "live diagram" in commits, tasks, or documentation

## Required Action:
1. **Embed or link** the visual asset into relevant context within `THEPLAN.md`, `docs/system_architecture_overview.md`, or relevant `.mdc` rule files.
2. If diagram is abstract or meta-level, explain its relation to either:
   - a specific VANTA agent (e.g., VantaMasterCore)
   - a symbolic construct (e.g., TriNode, Memory Relic, WhisperSeed)
3. Update any live diagram references or symbolic execution notes.
4. Annotate commit messages with `#visual_integration` and reference this rule.

## Enforcement:
- Failing to link visual artifacts to documentation will result in the PR being flagged for context loss.
- GitOpsAgent may auto-comment on PRs missing visual linkage.

## Purpose:
Maintain alignment between symbolic reasoning structures, dynamic visual feedback systems, and VANTA's narrative development loop.

## Example:
> Added `vanta_agi_kernel_final.mmd` → linked it to `THEPLAN.md` under `Phase 6: Advanced Features` with description of how the collapse arc is rendered visually.
