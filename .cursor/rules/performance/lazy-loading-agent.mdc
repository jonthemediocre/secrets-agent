# Performance Agent Rule Example

## Description

This is an example agent rule for performance optimization and monitoring. It demonstrates the proper structure and content for rules in the performance category.

## Rule Implementation

This rule provides guidance to AI assistants and code completion tools. It influences suggestions and automated assistance.

## Examples

### Good Pattern

```javascript
// Example of following this rule
const examplePattern = {
  // Implementation that follows best practices
  property: 'value'
};
```

### Poor Pattern

```javascript
// Example of violating this rule
var badPattern = {
  // Implementation that violates the rule
  prop: 'val'
};
```

## Rationale

This rule exists to:
- Promote best practices in performance optimization and monitoring
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Prevent common mistakes and issues
- Support maintainable code patterns
