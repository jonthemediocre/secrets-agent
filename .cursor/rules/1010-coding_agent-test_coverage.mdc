## Test Coverage Requirements
- Every new feature or module must include a pytest test file under `tests/` covering its functionality.
- Tests must mock or stub external dependencies (HTTP calls, subprocesses, file I/O) using fixtures or `monkeypatch`.
- New code additions should achieve at least 80% coverage for the affected module(s).
- Use parametrized tests and fixtures to minimize duplication and enhance readability.
- Test error and edge-case behaviors, including exception paths.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```python
import pytest
from src.my_module import MyClass

def test_myclass_success(monkeypatch):
    # stub external call
    monkeypatch.setenv('API_KEY', 'dummy')
    instance = MyClass()
    assert instance.do_action() == 'expected'

@pytest.mark.parametrize('input,expected', [(1,2),(3,4)])
def test_compute(input, expected):
    assert MyClass().compute(input) == expected
```

❌ Bad:
```python
# No tests for new module
# feature.py created without feature_test.py
```
