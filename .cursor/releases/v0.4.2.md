# Release v0.4.2 â€“ Symbolic Collapse Hooks + Replay Utility

This release marks a significant step towards a KEB-aware, symbolically trackable VANTA system with enhanced introspective capabilities.

## Key Achievements:

*   **Enhanced `TODO.md`:**
    *   Integrated new tasks for `GenesisOperator.v1` scaffolding.
    *   Added `BOOT_SEQUENCE_START` event listener for `VantaMasterCore`.
    *   Incorporated `QuadrantLogger` KEB listener tasks.
    *   Included KEB Event Replay Utility development.
    *   Added WebSocket visual dashboard task for live symbolic activity.
*   **KEB Event Replay Utility (`scripts/replay_keb_log.py`):**
    *   Implemented a CLI tool to replay and filter events from the `agentic_replay.log.jsonl`.
    *   Supports filtering by `event_type` and `agent_id`.
    *   Allows configurable delay for event replay.
*   **KEB Scaffolding Confirmations:**
    *   Implicitly confirmed the foundational KEB client (`keb_client.py`) and its integration for event publishing in `VantaMasterCore`.
    *   Advanced the system towards a more reactive, event-driven architecture.

## Next Steps:

*   Sync symbolic expansion into `/kernel/postulates/ToE-collapse.yaml`.
*   Generate formal event schema files and governance rules.
*   Continue development of `GenesisOperator.v1` and other symbolic layer agents.
