# RULE TYPE: Best Practice
# RULE ID: 907-plan-todo-sync
# FILE PATTERNS: THEPLAN.md, TODO.md

# 907: Plan ↔️ TODO Synchronization Guideline

## 1. Purpose

To ensure that the actionable tasks listed in `TODO.md` remain aligned with the strategic goals, architectural decisions, and implementation details documented in the primary planning document (`THEPLAN.md`).

## 2. Trigger Conditions

This rule should be considered or automatically suggested when:
-   Significant structural changes or additions are made to `THEPLAN.md` (e.g., adding new major sections, defining new core components/agents, altering phase goals).
-   A complex integration task involving multiple files (like the recent reference project audit) modifies `THEPLAN.md` substantially.
-   Before starting a new major phase outlined in `THEPLAN.md`.

## 3. Required Action

After significant modifications to `THEPLAN.md`:
1.  **Review `THEPLAN.md` Changes:** Identify new requirements, components, dependencies, or shifts in priority introduced by the changes.
2.  **Review `TODO.md`:** Check if existing tasks still accurately reflect the updated plan.
3.  **Add New Tasks:** Create new entries in `TODO.md` for any newly identified implementation steps, design decisions, or scaffolding tasks derived from the `THEPLAN.md` updates. Use clear, actionable language.
4.  **Modify Existing Tasks:** Update descriptions, priorities, or dependencies of existing tasks in `TODO.md` if the plan changes affect them.
5.  **Remove Obsolete Tasks:** Delete tasks from `TODO.md` that are no longer relevant due to changes in the plan.
6.  **Consider Sequencing:** Use "Domino Mode" principles to ensure logical sequencing of new/updated tasks in `TODO.md`.

## 4. Rationale

Maintaining synchronization prevents:
-   Working on tasks based on outdated plans.
-   Missing critical implementation steps implied by new architectural decisions.
-   Losing track of the actionable steps needed to realize the vision documented in `THEPLAN.md`.

## 5. Example Scenario

After integrating the symbolic layer definitions from `vanta_agi_definitions.md` into `THEPLAN.md`, this rule prompts a review of `TODO.md` to add tasks for scaffolding the newly defined symbolic agents (e.g., `DeltaModelerAgent`) and implementing related KEB events.
