# Page Structure Guidelines

## Next.js App Router Page Structure
- Use `page.tsx` files for route components
- Implement metadata in each page for SEO optimization
- Use layout components for shared UI elements
- Handle loading states with Loading components
- Implement error handling with Error components

## Page Components
- Keep page components focused on data fetching and layout
- Extract complex UI into separate components
- Use server components when possible for performance
- Implement client components only when needed for interactivity

- Create new pages at: `apps/web/app/(app)/PAGE_NAME/page.tsx`
- Components for the page are either put in `page.tsx`, or in the `apps/web/app/(app)/PAGE_NAME` folder
- Pages are Server components so you can load data into them directly
- If we're in a deeply nested component we will use `swr` to fetch via API
- If you need to use `onClick` in a component, that component is a client component and file must start with `use client`
