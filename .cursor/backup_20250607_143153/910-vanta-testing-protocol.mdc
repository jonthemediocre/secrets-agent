- All Protocol, API, and Agent logic must be tested via `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio`.
- For asynchronous tests and fixtures, use `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` and `@pytest.mark.asyncio` correctly to ensure proper event loop management and fixture resolution.
- Ritual + MCP Cascade workflows must be validated using `pytest-bdd` or `pytest-scenario`.
- FastAPI endpoints must be tested using `httpx` + `pytest-httpx`.
- Agent interaction and orchestration scenarios must use mocking frameworks (`pytest-mock`).
- MCP Signals and replay logs must be verified against schema using `pydantic` and log analysis.
- Agent contracts must be validated with `mypy` + runtime `pydantic` model checks.
- Code formatting and linting is mandatory via `black` and `flake8`.
