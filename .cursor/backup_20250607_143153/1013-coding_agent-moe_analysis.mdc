## MoE for Analysis
- For complex analysis functions (e.g., log parsing, pattern detection), consider breaking down the logic into specialized "expert" sub-methods (MoE pattern).
- The main analysis method should orchestrate calls to these experts and aggregate their findings.
- This improves modularity, testability, and allows easier specialization or replacement of analysis components.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```python
class AnalyzerAgent:
    def analyze(self, data):
        results = []
        results.extend(self._analyze_errors(data))
        results.extend(self._analyze_performance(data))
        return self._aggregate(results)
    def _analyze_errors(self, data): ...
    def _analyze_performance(self, data): ...
    def _aggregate(self, results): ...
```

❌ Bad:
```python
# Monolithic analysis function
class AnalyzerAgent:
    def analyze(self, data):
        # Complex logic for errors AND performance...
        pass
```
