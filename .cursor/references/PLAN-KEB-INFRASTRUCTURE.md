# PLAN-KEB-INFRASTRUCTURE: KEB Infrastructure Plan

**Date:** 2023-10-05

## Objective

Outline the deployment and management strategy for the Redis Streams event broker underpinning the Kernel Event Bus (KEB).

## Broker Architecture & Provisioning

- **Technology:** Redis (>=6.2) with native Streams support.
- **Deployment Model:** Highly-available cluster using Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster.
- **Persistence:** Enabled AOF for durable event storage, with nightly backups to object storage.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Terraform modules under `infra/redis-streams/` to provision network, clusters, and security groups.

## Networking & Security

- Restrict inbound traffic to application subnets and CI/CD runners via security group rules.
- Enable TLS encryption in-transit and at-rest using managed certificates.

## Monitoring & Alerting

- Integrate Redis metrics with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- Key alerts:
  - Stream backlog length exceeding threshold.
  - Node availability/failover events.
  - Latency spikes on XREAD operations.

## Capacity Planning

- Estimated throughput: ~100 events/sec average, ~500 events/sec peak.
- Configure stream shards and replication factor to match retention and throughput requirements.

## Maintenance & Operations

- Define maintenance windows for failover testing and major version upgrades.
- Automate patching and configuration drift detection via configuration management (Ansible/Chef).

## Next Steps
- Review Terraform modules and secure approval from DevOps team.
- Define CI/CD integration for ramp-up, connectivity tests, and schema rollout.
