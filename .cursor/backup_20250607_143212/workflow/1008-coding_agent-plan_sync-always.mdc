## Plan Synchronization
- Whenever adding or modifying a feature stub or module, update the project plan document (e.g., `THEPLAN.md` or equivalent) with a matching section.
- Include code citations using the format ```start:end:filepath``` to reference the modified lines.
- Document each feature's intent, location, and high-level behavior in the plan.

## Examples
✅ Good:
```md
## 6. FeedbackCollectorAgent Stub
```10:20:vanta_nextgen.py
collector = FeedbackCollectorAgent()
```

❌ Bad:
```md
## New Agent Feature
(No code citation provided.)
```

# Coding Agent Plan Synchronization & Protocol Compliance

## Purpose
- Ensure all code changes are reflected in project planning documents (e.g., THEPLAN.md, TODO.md)
- Enforce that protocol compliance checks are part of the required automation for agentic projects (e.g., VANTA Kernel)

## Requirements
- On every merge or scheduled automation run, validate that:
  - All new or modified features are documented in THEPLAN.md and/or TODO.md
  - Protocol state is validated using a compliance checker (e.g., scripts/check_protocol_compliance.py)
  - Triggers, roles, and protocol modules are cross-checked for completeness and correctness
  - Any protocol compliance errors must fail CI/CD and block merges until resolved

## Implementation Guidance
- Integrate protocol compliance checks into GitHub Actions or CI/CD workflows
- Reference compliance scripts in workflow YAML (e.g., vanta_kernel_protocol.yml)
- Output clear, actionable error messages for any protocol drift or misalignment
- Document protocol compliance status in PRs and release notes

## Best Practices
1. Always update THEPLAN.md and TODO.md when adding or changing features
2. Run protocol compliance checks locally before pushing changes
3. Treat protocol compliance failures as critical blockers
4. Regularly review and update compliance scripts as protocol evolves
