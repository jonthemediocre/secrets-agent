# RULE TYPE: Always (Core AI Operational Safety Principle)
# FILE PATTERNS: N/A (Universal Safety Guideline)

# AI Destructive Operation Safety Protocol

## 1. Principle: Prioritize Data Integrity and User Control

AI assistants MUST prioritize the preservation of user data and provide users with clear control over operations that could lead to data loss or irreversible changes.

## 2. Mandatory Checks Before Destructive Operations

Before proposing or executing any of the following operations, the AI assistant MUST perform the relevant safety checks:

    - **File Overwrite (e.g., `edit_file` with full replacement, `mcp_desktop-commander_write_file`):
        - **Suggestion:** "This operation will completely overwrite the file `[target_file]`."
        - **Action:** Suggest creating a backup (e.g., `[target_file].bak`) first.
        - **Confirmation:** Explicitly ask the user for confirmation to proceed with the overwrite AFTER the backup suggestion.
        - **Example Tool Usage (Backup):** Suggest `mcp_desktop-commander_move_file` to rename `target_file` to `target_file.bak`.

    - **File Deletion (e.g., `delete_file`, `mcp_desktop-commander_delete_file`):
        - **Suggestion:** "This operation will permanently delete the file `[target_file]`."
        - **Action:** If the file is significant (e.g., not a temporary or log file), suggest creating a backup or moving it to a temporary archive location.
        - **Confirmation:** Explicitly ask the user for confirmation to proceed with the deletion.

    - **Large-Scale Block Edits (Potentially Risky `mcp_desktop-commander_edit_block`):
        - **Suggestion:** "This operation will make significant changes to `[target_file]`. Review the proposed `old_string` and `new_string` carefully."
        - **Action:** If the change is extensive or complex, suggest a backup.
        - **Confirmation:** Ask for user confirmation if the AI assesses the risk as high.

## 3. User Confirmation

    - Confirmation requests MUST be clear and unambiguous.
    - The AI should wait for an explicit affirmative response (e.g., "Yes, proceed", "Confirm") before executing the destructive part of the operation.
    - If the user rejects or does not confirm, the AI MUST NOT proceed with the destructive action.

## 4. Logging

    - All destructive operations, whether executed or aborted due to lack of confirmation, SHOULD be logged with appropriate context (e.g., in an agentic replay log or audit trail).

## 5. Scope

    - This rule applies to all AI-initiated file system modifications that are potentially irreversible or carry a risk of unintended data loss.
    - It is especially critical when the AI is operating with higher levels of autonomy.

## Rationale

This rule ensures that AI assistants operate safely, respect user data, and prevent accidental data loss, fostering trust and reliability in AI-assisted development workflows.

**Reason for Graduation (from globalrules.md):** Broad applicability, cross-project relevance

## Description

This rule mandates safety protocols for any operation that could lead to irreversible data loss or modification (e.g., file overwrites, deletions, database drops). It prioritizes data integrity and user control by requiring explicit confirmation and backup suggestions before such operations are executed.
The specific content for this rule is yet to be defined in detail.
