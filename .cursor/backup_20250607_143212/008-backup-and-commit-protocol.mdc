# Backup and Commit Protocol

## Purpose
Establish a robust, auditable, and agentic protocol for regular project backups and git commits, ensuring safety, traceability, and compliance with VANTA's agentic development philosophy.

## Triggers & Frequency
- **Manual:**
  - On-demand by any contributor or agent before/after major changes.
- **Scheduled:**
  - At least daily (recommended: nightly at 2am local time).
  - Optionally, hourly during periods of rapid development.
- **Agentic/Automated:**
  - Before/after major refactors, migrations, or mass file operations.
  - After successful completion of major agentic workflows (e.g., rituals, cascades, agentic replay events).
  - Before deployments or releases.
  - After new agent, rule, or protocol is added to `.cursor/rules/`.

## How to Execute
- Use `scripts/backup_script.py` with appropriate flags:
  - `--commit` to commit all changes after backup
  - `--push` to push to remote after commit
  - `--backup-id` to specify context (e.g., `pre-refactor`, `scheduled`, `post-ritual`)
- Example:
  ```bash
  python scripts/backup_script.py instance_a /path/to/instance_a --commit --push --backup-id "pre-major-refactor"
  ```
- Agents and rituals should invoke this script as a subprocess at the above triggers.

## Logging & Audit
- All backup, commit, and push actions must be logged (stdout, file, or agentic replay log).
- Each event should include timestamp, triggering agent/human, context (backup-id), and result.
- Failures must be reported and retried or escalated.

## Exclusions
- Do not back up or commit `.git/`, `.venv/`, cache, or other non-essential files (script and MutationManager already handle this).
- Use `.gitignore` to manage exclusions for memory/log files as appropriate.

## Documentation
- Reference this protocol in `THEPLAN.md` and/or `README.md`.
- Document any deviations or exceptions in project docs.

## Best Practices
1. Test backup/restore regularly.
2. Store some backups offsite/cloud for disaster recovery.
3. Use structured commit messages for agentic/automated commits.
4. Review logs periodically for compliance.

## Integration
- This protocol is compatible with all other safety, logging, and agentic rules in `.cursor/rules/`.
- Agents must not bypass this protocol for any high-impact or destructive operation.
