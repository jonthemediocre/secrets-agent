# 003: L2 Enforces L3 UAP-MDC Compliance (RULE INDEX)

## Purpose
This rule has been **SPLIT INTO FOCUSED COMPONENTS** for better maintainability and clarity. The original 375-line rule violated the single responsibility principle.

## Focused Rule Components

### 1. UAP Production Requirements
**File:** `003-L2-uap-production-requirements.mdc`
**Covers:** Mandatory file structures, agent archetype patterns, production context detection

### 2. Agent Bus Integration  
**File:** `003-L2-agent-bus-integration.mdc`
**Covers:** VantaMasterCore integration, BaseAgent compliance, CascadeExecutor patterns, MCP validation

### 3. Competitive Benchmarking
**File:** `003-L2-competitive-benchmarking.mdc`  
**Covers:** Benchmarking implementation, configuration schema, performance thresholds

### 4. Cascade Profile Compliance
**File:** `003-L2-cascade-profile-compliance.mdc`
**Covers:** Production deployment cascades, failure recovery, auto-scaffolding, development blocking

## Benefits of Split
- ✅ **Single Responsibility:** Each rule focuses on one concern
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Easier to update individual components
- ✅ **Readability:** Rules are digestible and understandable
- ✅ **Modularity:** Components can be enabled/disabled independently
- ✅ **Testing:** Individual rules can be validated separately

## Migration Note
**Previous Rule Status:** ARCHIVED (was 375 lines, violated clarity principle)
**New Implementation:** 4 focused rules totaling ~200 lines with better organization
