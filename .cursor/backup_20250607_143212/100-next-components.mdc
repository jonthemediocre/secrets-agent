# Next.js Component Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Use "use client" directive for Client Components
- Server Components must NOT use "use client"
- Metadata can only be exported from Server Components
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Separate layout concerns from content

## File Organization
- Page components go in `src/app/**/page.tsx`
- Layout components go in `src/app/**/layout.tsx`
- Error handling components go in `src/app/**/error.tsx`
- Loading states go in `src/app/**/loading.tsx`
- API routes go in `src/app/api/**/route.ts`

## Error Handling
- Each page should have proper error boundaries
- Implement fallback UI for error states
- Log errors with appropriate context

## Data Fetching
- Use React Query for client-side data fetching
- Server Components should fetch data directly
- Handle loading and error states consistently

## Performance
- Use proper component memoization
- Implement suspense boundaries for loading states
- Optimize image loading with Next.js Image component
- Use route prefetching appropriately
