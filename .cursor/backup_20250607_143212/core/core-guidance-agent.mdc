# Core Agent Rule Example

## Description

This is an example agent rule for core language rules (variables, functions, classes). It demonstrates the proper structure and content for rules in the core category.

## Rule Implementation

This rule provides guidance to AI assistants and code completion tools. It influences suggestions and automated assistance.

## Examples

### Good Pattern

```javascript
// Example of following this rule
const examplePattern = {
  // Implementation that follows best practices
  property: 'value'
};
```

### Poor Pattern

```javascript
// Example of violating this rule
var badPattern = {
  // Implementation that violates the rule
  prop: 'val'
};
```

## Rationale

This rule exists to:
- Promote best practices in core language rules (variables, functions, classes)
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Prevent common mistakes and issues
- Support maintainable code patterns

## Related Rules

- See other rules in the core/ folder
- Consider complementary rules in related folders
- Review always rules that may take precedence

## Notes

This is an example rule for demonstration purposes. Modify it according to your specific needs and requirements.
