# Open Source MDC Rules

We've incorporated MDC rules from the [inbox-zero](mdc:https:/github.com/elie222/inbox-zero) repository by Elie Steinbock to enhance our development practices. These rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/opensource/` and provide guidelines for various aspects of development.

## Available Rules

- **api-routes.mdc**: Guidelines for API route implementation and structure
- **cleaner.mdc**: Code cleanliness and formatting standards
- **cursor-rules.mdc**: Meta-guidelines for creating and managing MDC rules
- **data-fetching.mdc**: Best practices for data fetching using SWR and other methods
- **environment-variables.mdc**: Managing environment variables and configuration
- **form-handling.mdc**: Implementation of forms, validation, and error handling
- **llm.mdc**: Implementation of LLM (Language Model) functionality
- **llm-test.mdc**: Testing strategies for LLM implementations
- **logging.mdc**: Logging standards and best practices
- **page-structure.mdc**: Page structure and organization
- **prisma.mdc**: Database access patterns using Prisma
- **project-structure.mdc**: Project organization and file structure
- **server-actions.mdc**: Implementation of Next.js server actions
- **testing.mdc**: General testing strategies and best practices
- **ui-components.mdc**: UI component implementation using Shadcn UI and Tailwind
- **utilities.mdc**: Utility function organization and best practices

## Usage

These rules provide reference patterns from a production app that can be adapted to our needs. They can be useful as:

1. **Learning resources**: Understanding best practices from another production app
2. **Inspiration**: Adapting patterns to fit our own architecture
3. **Reference**: Consulting when implementing similar features

## Integration with Our Rules

Our own MDC rules take precedence over these open source rules. When there are conflicts:

1. Follow our project-specific rules first
2. Use open source rules as supplementary guidance
3. Document any adaptations made in our AI learnings

## Updating
