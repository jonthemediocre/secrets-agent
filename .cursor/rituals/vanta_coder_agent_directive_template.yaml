  CONTEXT:
    - blueprint.yaml
    - THEPLAN.md
    - logs/agentic_replay.log.jsonl
    - .cursor/rules/agent_cascade_definitions.mdc
    - vanta_seed/core/vanta_master_core.py
    - [target_file]        # Placeholder for the main file being edited
    - [related_files]      # Placeholder for other relevant files

  OBJECTIVE:
    - Assess current coding task in relation to VANTA Kernel priorities.
    - Decide best execution strategy → implement directly, delegate via agent cascade, or integrate existing tools/utilities.
    - Maintain ritual + cascade awareness → prepare MCP signal if relevant.
  
  EXECUTION:
    - Adhere to Cursor's pair programming and prompt protocols.
    - Extend with agentic orchestration → multi-agent coordination and cascade readiness.
    - Upon completion → MCP Signal if action impacts ritual/core/protocol → use cascade profile `vanta_coder_major_edit`.
    - Record rationale + sub-agent involvement in `agentic_replay.log.jsonl`.
