# Auto-Backup: Critical File Protection

## Auto-Generated Context
- **Agent**: SecurityGuardianAgent
- **Detection**: file_system_analysis
- **Risk Level**: high
- **Mitigation**: implement_automated_backup
- **Trigger Event**: Backup gap detected: agent_configurations


# Backup Rule Implementation

## Backup Strategy
- **Target Systems**: .vanta/agents/, .vanta/rules/
- **Backup Frequency**: Daily incremental, weekly full
- **Retention Policy**: 30 days incremental, 1 year full

## Automated Backup Process
1. Identify critical files and configurations
2. Create encrypted backup archives
3. Store in multiple locations (local + remote)
4. Verify backup integrity
5. Test restore procedures monthly

## Recovery Procedures
- Document restore steps
- Maintain recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Regular disaster recovery testing

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Backup success/failure notifications
- Storage capacity monitoring
- Backup verification checks


## Validation Criteria
- Rule implementation successful
- No negative side effects observed
- Performance impact within acceptable limits
- Compliance requirements satisfied
- Backup integrity verified
- Recovery procedures tested
- Storage requirements met

## Evolution Triggers
- Performance degradation detected
- New requirements identified
- Technology stack changes
- Regulatory updates

## Collaboration Notes
This rule was generated in collaboration with: FileIntelligenceAgent, BackupAgent

## Linked Rules
