# Auto-Trinity: executor_overload Coordination

## Auto-Generated Context
- **Agent**: SecurityGuardianAgent
- **Detection**: trinity_monitoring
- **Risk Level**: high
- **Mitigation**: rebalance_trinity_roles
- **Trigger Event**: Trinity coordination issue: executor_overload


# Trinity Coordination Rule

## Trinity Node Rebalancing
- **Affected Nodes**: dodecahedron_agents
- **Coordination Issue**: Trinity coordination issue: executor_overload

## Role Redistribution Strategy
1. Assess current node performance
2. Identify imbalance causes
3. Redistribute roles and responsibilities
4. Implement coordination protocols
5. Monitor harmony metrics

## Consensus Mechanisms
- Decision-making protocols
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Collaboration enhancement
- Communication optimization

## Harmony Metrics
- Role efficiency scores
- Collaboration effectiveness
- Consensus achievement rate
- System-wide coherence


## Validation Criteria
- Rule implementation successful
- No negative side effects observed
- Performance impact within acceptable limits
- Compliance requirements satisfied
- Trinity harmony restored
- Node coordination improved
- Consensus mechanisms functional

## Evolution Triggers
- Performance degradation detected
- New requirements identified
- Technology stack changes
- Regulatory updates
- Trinity role evolution
- Coordination pattern changes
- Harmony metric degradation

## Collaboration Notes
This rule was generated in collaboration with: TrinityCoordinator, ConsensusAgent
