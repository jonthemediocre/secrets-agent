# Secrets Agent Roadmap
*Strategic Development Plan - 2025*

## ðŸ§¬ Mission & Vision

**Secrets Agent** is evolving beyond a mere secrets manager into a foundational **agentic infrastructure component**.

**Core Mission:** To provide an exceptionally secure, locally-hosted, and programmatically extensible vault for managing secrets, configurations, and eventually, agentic toolsets.

**Strategic Vision:** To serve as a private, auditable, and resilient backbone for both human developers and autonomous AI agents, enabling secure and efficient secret access, lifecycle management, and inter-agent cooperation.

## ðŸš€ Core Architectural Pillars

- **Agent-Native by Design:** Engineered from the ground up to be queried, mutated, and extended by other software agents
- **Real Cryptographic Rigor:** Anchored in robust, auditable encryption using SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) with Age encryption
- **Local-First, Encrypted Storage:** All vault data stored locally and encrypted, ensuring user control and privacy
- **Rich, Project-Based Vault Schema:** Structured, project-aware vault with comprehensive metadata per secret
- **Cross-Platform Parity:** Consistent experience across mobile, web, CLI, and desktop interfaces
- **Token-Aware HTTP Management:** Integrated capabilities for secure token handling and refresh

## ðŸ“‹ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Vault & Authentication âœ… COMPLETE
- [âœ…] Secure User Authentication (Google OAuth, PKCE, token management)
- [âœ…] Foundational Vault Structure with CRUD operations
- [âœ…] SOPS Encrypted Vault I/O with CLI integration
- [âœ…] Cross-Platform Feature Parity (Web, CLI, VS Code, Windows GUI)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Vault Operations ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ðŸ”„] Full .env Import/Export Flow (UI & Logic)
- [ðŸ“‹] Secret Rotation Tracking & Reminders
- [ðŸ“‹] Per-Secret Access Logs (Auditing)
- [ðŸ“‹] Environment Switching UX (dev, stage, prod vaults)
- [ðŸ“‹] Vault File Switching / Multi-Profile Mode

### Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Features ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
- [ðŸ“‹] Secret Suggestion via Code/README Scan (SecretScaffoldAgent)
- [ðŸ“‹] Secret History Timeline (Visual)
- [ðŸ“‹] Secrets Misuse Detection (Watchdog)
- [ðŸ“‹] Multi-Key Sharing for Vaults (Age Recipients)
- [ðŸ“‹] Vault Fingerprint Hashing (Integrity Check)

### Phase 4: Runtime Secret Delivery âœ… COMPLETE
- [âœ…] VaultAccessAgent for secure runtime secret delivery
- [âœ…] API-based encrypted retrieval with JWT tokens
- [âœ…] CLI integration for token generation and secret injection
- [âœ…] Comprehensive test suite and documentation

### Phase 5: MCP Bridge Integration ðŸ“‹ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
- [ðŸ“‹] Master Control Program (MCP) Bridge capabilities
- [ðŸ“‹] Cross-platform tool orchestration
- [ðŸ“‹] External tool discovery and execution
- [ðŸ“‹] Security integration with existing vault management

### Phase 6: Production Infrastructure ðŸ”„ ONGOING
- [ðŸ”„] Production monitoring dashboard
- [ðŸ”„] Deployment pipeline automation
- [ðŸ”„] Performance optimization
- [ðŸ”„] Enterprise vault integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities (Q2 2025)
1. **Documentation Consolidation** - Streamline scattered documentation into organized structure
2. **MCP Bridge Implementation** - Enable external tool orchestration capabilities
3. **Production Hardening** - Optimize performance and monitoring

### Near-term Goals (Q3 2025)
1. **Advanced Vault Features** - Secret rotation, lifecycle management
2. **Enhanced Security** - Multi-key sharing, granular permissions
3. **Developer Experience** - Improved onboarding, better tooling

### Long-term Vision (Q4 2025 & Beyond)
1. **Enterprise Features** - Team collaboration, audit trails
2. **Ecosystem Integration** - Plugin architecture, marketplace
3. **AI-Native Operations** - Autonomous secret management, predictive rotation

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
- React Native/Web platform conflicts resolution
- TypeScript `any` error elimination (174 errors identified)
- Performance optimization for large vault operations

### Medium Priority
- Code consolidation across platform implementations
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation standardization

### Low Priority
- Legacy code cleanup
- UI/UX consistency improvements
- Developer tooling enhancements

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Security Score**: 10/10 (enterprise-grade)
- **Performance**: Sub-second vault operations
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Test Coverage**: >90% across all components

### User Experience Metrics
- **Onboarding Time**: <5 minutes to first secret
- **Platform Parity**: Feature consistency across all interfaces
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Streamlined workflows, clear documentation

### Business Metrics
- **Adoption**: Growing user base across platforms
- **Enterprise Readiness**: Production deployment capability
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Third-party tool compatibility
