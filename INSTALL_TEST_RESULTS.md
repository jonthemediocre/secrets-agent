# üöÄ Secrets Agent Installation & Testing Results

## ‚úÖ Components Tested

### 1. Docker Containerization
- Successfully built and deployed all containers
- API, watcher, and VS Code extension backend running correctly
- Docker volumes properly mounted for persistent storage
- Network bridge established between containers

### 2. Windows Executable
- Successfully built the Windows executable (`vanta.exe`)
- Executable can scan projects and detect environment variables & tools
- Can be used as standalone tool on Windows without Docker

### 3. REST API
- All API endpoints working correctly:
  - `/api/health` - System status and version check
  - `/api/scan` - Project scanning for env vars and tools
  - `/api/list-secrets` - Listing available secrets in store
  - `/api/add-secret` - Adding new secrets to the secure store
  - `/api/link` - Linking projects to secrets (in server implementation)

### 4. Secure Encrypted Storage
- Successfully implemented end-to-end encryption for secrets
- All secrets are securely encrypted with AES-256 using master password
- Encryption is properly integrated with Docker containers
- Environment variables properly pass the master password to containers
- Secure storage works with all API endpoints
- No plaintext secrets are stored on disk

### 5. Environment Setup
- Production-ready Docker Compose configuration
- Proper volume mounting for persistent data
- Environment variables configured for security and authentication
- Configuration files properly loaded and processed

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Options Summary

### Option 1: Docker Deployment (Most Production-Ready)
- Full infrastructure with API, watcher, and VS Code extension
- Containerized for consistent deployment across environments
- Persistent storage with Docker volumes
- Network isolation through Docker bridge network

### Option 2: Windows Executable
- Standalone Windows executable for simple usage
- No Docker dependency required
- Easy to distribute to end users
- Limited to command-line interface

### Option 3: Development Installation
- Python package installation via `pip install -e .`
- Direct access to the Python API
- Full customizability through Python codebase
- Best for integration with custom workflows

## üîß Steps to Deploy in Production

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up `.env` file with required API keys
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to deploy the full stack
4. Access API at `http://localhost:5000` and VS Code extension backend at `http://localhost:5001`
5. For VS Code integration, install the provided extension 

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. Complete VS Code extension integration testing
2. Implement automatic API key rotation
3. Add HTTPS support for production deployments
4. Create CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
5. Add more comprehensive security testing

## üìã System Requirements

- **Host OS**: Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Container OS**: Debian (Python 3.9 slim)
- **Memory**: Minimum 1GB RAM (2GB+ recommended)
- **Storage**: 500MB minimum for base installation
- **CPU**: 1+ cores
- **Network**: Internet connection for initial setup (optional for operation)

## üîê Security Assessment

- Secrets are fully encrypted at rest
- Master password never stored, only password hash kept
- Strong encryption with Fernet symmetric encryption (AES-256)
- Password-based key derivation with 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations
- Secure random salt generation
- No plaintext secrets in logs or Docker environment
- Only authorized users with master password can access secrets
