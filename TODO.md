# âœ… TODO.md - Secrets Agent Action Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Priorities (Phase 2 Kickoff)

- [X] **P1: Implement `VaultAgent.test.ts` - Fully Mocked SOPS Test Harness**
    - [X] Define mock strategies for `child_process.exec` (to simulate `sops` CLI).
    - [X] Prepare/generate mock encrypted fixture data.
    - [X] Test `loadVault()` scenarios: file not found, empty file, valid encrypted file, corrupted data after decryption, sops CLI errors.
    - [X] Test `saveVault()` scenarios: successful encryption, sops CLI errors during encryption/write.
    - [X] Verify core CRUD operations function correctly through the encrypted load/save cycle.

## ðŸ”¬ Kernel Event Bus (KEB) Integration (Phase 1 & 2)

- [X] **P_KEB_1: [KEB] Finalize and Approve KEB Design (`ADR-VMC-KEB-001`).** (Completed)
- [X] **P_KEB_2: [KEB] Select and document the chosen event broker technology.** (Completed: Redis Streams)
- [X] **P_KEB_3: [KEB] Draft initial v1 event schemas for core system interactions (Lifecycle, Tasking, Data).** (Completed: Schemas found in `event_schemas/`)
- [X] **P_KEB_4: [KEB] Develop PoC for event publishing/consuming library.** (Completed: `keb_client.py` implemented)
- [X] **P_KEB_5: [KEB] Complete VantaMasterCore KEB Integration.** (Completed)
- [>] **P_KEB_6: [KEB] Identify KEB Pilot Agents (`DataUnifierAgent`, `CollapseMonitorAgent`).** (Status: Significant Progress)
- [>] **P_KEB_7: [INFRA] Plan KEB Infrastructure (Redis Streams event broker deployment & management).** (Status: Significant Progress)
- [X] **P_KEB_8: [GOVERNANCE] Establish KEB Event Governance (`.cursor/rules/101-event-governance.mdc`).** (Completed)

## ðŸš€ Near-Term Goals (Phase 2 Core Features)

- [!] **P2.1: Implement `EnvParser.ts` utility and tests.** (User provided, assumed complete)
- [!] **P2.2: Enhance `VaultAgent.ts` with `.env` import/export skeletal methods.** (User provided, assumed complete)
- [>] **P2.3: UI Component `EnvManagerPanel.tsx` - Implement the panel for `.env` import/export. (Blocked by manual linter/tsconfig fixes)**
- [!] **P2.X: UI Component `AppLayout.tsx` - Drafted (New based on Vault UI inspiration)**
    - [!] Requires manual review & fix: Linter errors (TS DOM lib, `@heroicons/react` import, syntax in example code commenting).
- [-] P2.4: Test Suite - Create tests for `VaultAgent.ts` (`.env` logic) and `EnvManagerPanel.tsx`.
  - [X] `VaultAgent.env.test.ts` (Initial draft done)
  - [-] `EnvManagerPanel.test.tsx` (Initial draft done, blocked by manual linter/setup fixes)

- [ ] **P2: Full `.env` Import/Export Flow (UI & Logic) - *Partially Blocked***
    - [ ] Design UI for 3-step import: `scan local .env file -> preview/confirm mappings -> commit to vault` (Covered by `EnvManagerPanel.tsx`)
    - [ ] Implement backend logic for parsing `.env` files. (Covered by `EnvParser.ts` & `EnvManagerPanel.tsx` frontend logic)
    - [ ] Handle potential conflicts with existing secrets (overwrite, skip, rename options). (Conceptualized in `EnvManagerPanel.tsx`)
    - [ ] Design UI for export: `select project/category/secrets -> filter options -> redact toggle -> download .env`. (Covered by `EnvManagerPanel.tsx`)
    - [ ] Implement backend logic for generating `.env` file content from vault data. (Conceptualized in `EnvManagerPanel.tsx` frontend logic, `VaultAgent.ts` methods assumed)

- [ ] **P3: Secret Rotation Tracking & Reminders (Backend + Dashboard Prep)**
    - [ ] Update `SecretEntry` interface in `VaultTypes.ts`:
        - Add `rotationPolicy?: { intervalDays: number; autoRotateScript?: string; }`
        - Add `lastRotated?: string;` (ISO timestamp)
        - Add `nextRotationDue?: string;` (ISO timestamp, calculated or set)
    - [ ] Update `VaultAgent` CRUD methods (`addSecret`, `updateSecret`) to handle/calculate these fields.
    - [ ] Implement logic in `VaultAgent` (or a new `RotationManagerAgent`) to identify secrets due for rotation.
    - [ ] Prepare data structures/getters for the future `SecretsPanel.tsx` to display rotation warnings/status.

- [ ] **Per-Secret Access Logs (Auditing - Initial Implementation)**
    - [ ] Update `SecretEntry` to include `accessedAt?: string[];` (array of ISO timestamps).
    - [ ] Modify `VaultAgent.getSecret()` (and any other direct secret value access points) to log access timestamps.
    - [ ] Consider if/how to log access for export operations.
    - [ ] *Future: Explore separate `.vault.accesslog.yaml` for more detailed/performant logging.*

- [ ] **Environment Switching UX (Initial UI Stub)**
    *   Design basic UI element (e.g., dropdown) in `SecretsPanel.tsx` (when it exists) to select active environment (dev, stage, prod).
    *   `VaultAgent` already supports loading differently named files; this is about UI to control which one is loaded.
    *   Consider auto-detection POC (e.g., based on a project's root `.git/HEAD` or a special project marker file).

## ðŸ’¡ Phase 3 & Visionary Threads (Backlog for now - For ThePlan.md)

*   Secret Suggestion via Code/README Scan (`SecretScaffoldAgent`)
*   Secrets Misuse Detection (Watchdog)
*   Multi-Key Sharing for Vaults (Age Recipients)
*   Vault Fingerprint Hashing (Integrity Check)
*   Per-Secret Access Control (Granular Permissions)
*   Secret History Timeline (Visual)
*   `.cursor rules MDC` system formalization & integration.
*   MCP Tool Repository as a Secure Vault (conceptual design).
*   A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Communication Standard & Manifest (spec design).
