- **Tier 1 Standard** (< 24 hours) - Medium-risk, standard changes, established patterns  
- **Tier 0 Automated** (< 4 hours) - Low-risk, non-critical, isolated changes

#### **Automatic Detection:**
```yaml
trigger_mechanisms:
  code_analysis: "File modification patterns, change magnitude thresholds"
  semantic_analysis: "Function modifications, dependency changes"
  risk_assessment: "Security impact, business criticality, compliance requirements"
  expert_assignment: "Rule-based allocation with escalation procedures"
```

### **3. Continuous Learning Integration**
**Components:** Cross-project knowledge capture, pattern recognition, framework evolution

#### **Learning Loops:**
- **Deployment Metrics** - Success rates, time-to-deployment, rollback frequency
- **Pattern Recognition** - AI-assisted bottleneck analysis and optimization identification
- **Knowledge Capture** - Successful strategies documentation and failure mode analysis
- **Framework Evolution** - Quarterly reviews with evidence-based improvements
