**Patterns Found:** MCP, mcp, Master Control Program, tools, code interpreters, or orchestration, API pattern), `MCPBridgeCore` might need to be extended with new methods. Correspondingly, `MCPBridge, API keys (`MCP_BRIDGE, MCPBridgeCore` implements retries for network errors and 5xx server, MCPBridgeCore` implements retries for network errors and 5xx server errors. Client, MCP Services via MCPBridge, MCPBridge` components (`MCPBridgeCore` and `MCPBridge, mcp_bridge.MCPBridge, mcp_bridge_agent.MCPBridgeAgent`**: A VANTA agent that acts as an adapter. It receives tasks from `VantaMasterCore` (or other agents) and uses `MCPBridge, MCP Bridge is typically managed in `vanta_seed/config/agents/mcp_bridge, MCP_BRIDGE, mcp_bridge, MCPBridge, mcp_tools: "list_tools"      # Task 'discover_mcp_tools' calls MCPBridge, mcp_tool: "execute_tool"          # Task 'run_mcp_tool' calls MCPBridge, mcp_job_status: "get_status"    # Task 'check_mcp_job_status' calls MCPBridge, mcp_bridge_core` and `mcp_bridge_agent`) to the `MCPBridge, MCP, other VANTA agents or `VantaMasterCore` will send a task to the `MCPBridge, mcp_action` (string, required): The high-level action for the `MCPBridge, mcp_bridge_main", // Target MCPBridge, MCPBridgeAgent` will return a task result with `status: "error"` or `status: "failure"`, an `error_message`, and potentially `output` containing details from `MCPBridge, MCP requires more than the standard `list_tools` and `execute_tool` actions (or a different API pattern), `MCPBridgeCore` might need to be extended with new methods. Correspondingly, `MCPBridge, MCPBridge` components (`MCPBridgeCore` and `MCPBridgeAgent`) provide a standardized way for VANTA projects to interact with external Master Control Program (MCP) services. This allows VANTA agents to leverage specialized tool, mcp_tools: "list_tools"      # Task 'discover_mcp_tools' calls MCPBridgeCore.list_tool, mcp_tool: "execute_tool"          # Task 'run_mcp_tool' calls MCPBridgeCore.execute_tool, mcp_action` (string, required): The high-level action for the `MCPBridgeAgent` to perform. This is typically one of the keys from the `action_mappings` in the agent's configuration (e.g., `"discover_mcp_tools"`, `"run_mcp_tool"`). It can also be the direct method names `"list_tools"`, `"execute_tool, mcp_action` maps to `"execute_tool"`. Specifies the name of the tool, mcp_action` maps to `"execute_tool"` and the tool expects parameters. A dictionary of parameters to pass to the MCP tool, MCP Tool, mcp_action": "discover_mcp_tool, mcp_action": "run_mcp_tool, MCPBridgeAgent` output (on success, structure depends on MCP tool, MCP's tool, MCP action 'execute_tool, MCP requires more than the standard `list_tools` and `execute_tool, MCP_BRIDGE_API_URL`: **Required**.
